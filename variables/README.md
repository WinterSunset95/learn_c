### Three different types of variables:
* ```int``` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as ```123``` or ```-123```
* ```float``` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as ```19.99``` and ```-19.99```
* ```char``` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes.

### Printing out values
* Must use format specifiers surrounded by DOUBLE quotes
> ```%d``` or ```%i``` for numbers
> ```%f``` for floats
> ```%c``` for characters

### Notes
* Values seem to be mutable
* Can declare variables without necessarily assigning a value. Eg:
```
int myNum = 15;
int myOtherNum;
myOtherNum = myNum

// myOtherNum now has value '15' assigned to it
```
