### Three different types of variables:
* ```int``` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as ```123``` or ```-123```
* ```float``` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as ```19.99``` and ```-19.99```
* ```char``` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes.
